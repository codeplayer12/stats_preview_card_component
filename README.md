## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Through this challenge I have learnt to use the flexbox, implement the after method in css. Also I have learnt to apply css variables for root colors.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<div class="some-image"></div>
```
```css
.some-image {
  background:url('./someplace.jpg');
}
.some-image::after{
  background-color: var(--primary-soft-violet);
}
```


### Continued development

Further development of the project, I would like to use sass for css studying.
